# Cracking The Coding Interview

## This repo shows my own programming skills.

I took these tasks from the great book "_Cracking The Coding Interview_" written by **Gayle Laakmann McDowell**.

## How to work with this repo?

You can see a links below with language tag and progress bar.

Each section was solved in a specific programming language. Progress means how far I have come, what tasks have been
completed.

There you can find a readme file with implementation details. Each task has a naive (mine) and an optimized (described
in the book) implementation. Does this mean that the naive will always be worse than the optimized one? — No, it's just
my own solution. First, I try to solve the problem on my own, this is how a naive implementation was created, then I read
the solution described in the book and implement it in a specific language. Sometimes I have exactly the same point of view, then
the task will have one solution.

You will also be able to clone this project, compile and run my solutions.
