# Cracking The Coding Interview

## About this Repository

This repository showcases my problem-solving and programming skills through exercises from the excellent book
“_Cracking the Coding Interview_” by **Gayle Laakmann McDowell**.

## How This Repository Is Organized

Below, you’ll find links to different sections of the book, each tagged with the programming language used, and a progress indicator showing how many problems have been completed.

Each section is implemented in a specific programming language and contains its own README with implementation details.

## Naive vs. Optimized Solutions

For most problems, you’ll find two implementations:

* Naive solution — my own initial attempt, created before reading the book’s explanation.
* Optimized solution — an implementation based on the approach described in the book.
  
There are also cases where the book does not present a clear “naive vs. optimized” distinction. In those situations, my implementation is simply aligned with the book’s solution, and no separate naive version exists.

## Running the Code

You can clone this repository, compile the code, and run all solutions locally. Each section includes instructions where necessary.
